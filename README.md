# Project Description
This project is based on predicting churning behaviour of customer of a telecom company.
we need to predict either customer will churn out or not. This is classification problem.

### Prerequisites
In Python, Make sure in your enviornment below packages are installed.

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, imblearn

In R, make sure below packages are installed:

ggplot2, corrgram, corrplot, randomForest, caret, class, e1071, mlr, grid, DMwR, irace, usdm

### Files Detail
* Train_data.csv and Test_data.csv containing dataset first will be used in builiding model second will be used in predicting and testing our model
* churn_prediction.py contain implemenation in Python
* churn_prediction.R contain implementation in R
* project_report_explained.pdf contain Process and anlysis done during this project

### Highlights
* SMOTE upsampling Used for Target imbalance case
* K-fold CV used for comaparing models
* Hyperparameter tuning used for improving preformance of models

Note: make sure to change path as per file location
